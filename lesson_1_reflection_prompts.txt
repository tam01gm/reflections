How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

A:it helps on focusing on changes between files and analyze each change in order to verify if it can be the cause of the error

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

A:it makes possible to make incremental comparison between version and track changes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

A:individual file are easier to track but multiple files tracking is more meaningful and powerful

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

because I know I can easily rollback my changes

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
